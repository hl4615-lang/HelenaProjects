                <p>Cloud F.A.R.T — Form of Atomic Recomposition &amp; Transmutation</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p><strong>Unclassified</strong> — a unique non-carbon-based organism with no known lineage.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><span style="color:lightgreen;">Generative and ever-changing</span></strong><br> — its form constantly evolves through loops, noise, and randomness, never repeating twice.</li>
                    <li><strong><span style="color:lightgreen;">Amorphous, cloud-like morphology</span></strong><br> — composed of colorful drifting particles that expand, dissolve, and reform as if breathing.</li>
                    <li><strong><span style="color:lightgreen;">Emotion-reactive behavior</span></strong><br> — shifts color, brightness, and motion when calm or disturbed by interaction.</li>
                    <li><strong><span style="color:lightgreen;">Responsive digital habitat</span></strong><br> — interacts with the dynamic environment and the viewer, keeping its existence alive through motion and energy flow.</li>
                    <li><strong><span style="color:lightgreen;">Atomic recomposition ability</span></strong><br> — alters nearby forms and colors upon contact, simulating matter transmutation.</li>
                
                </ul>
                   
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>From a non-carbon-based ecosystem beyond our known universe, and arrived on Earth through a transient wormhole. 
                <p>Its native environment likely consists of high-energy plasma fields where atomic structures can be freely rearranged
                    — conditions incompatible with terrestrial chemistry.</p>
                <p>Unable to survive in Earth's physical reality, it now inhabits an open digital atmosphere
                    — a simulated space of motion, noise, and fluctuating energy.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>An ever-shifting, soft, glowing cloud made of many luminous tiny particles.
                <p>Its shape is never fixed — it constantly shifts, expands, and contracts like a living mist.</p>
                <p>The particles vary in brightness and color, creating gentle pulses of light that change with its mood.</p>
                <p>At its center glows a faint rhythmic core, giving the impression of breathing or thought within the cloud.</p>

            <h3><span class="yellow"><strong>What we know so far about [ Cloud F.A.R.T]?</strong></span></h3>
            <p>Cloud F.A.R.T is a generative, ever-changing, non-carbon-based, cloud-like lifeform composed of countless luminous particles.</p>
                <p>Its amorphous body has no fixed structure—constantly expanding, contracting, and dissolving as if breathing. 
                Each micro-particle differs in brightness, opacity, and hue, forming a shimmering, living mist that hovers between visibility and disappearance.</p>
                The organism's movement emerges from randomness and interaction:
                it drifts curiously toward nearby motion yet scatters in sudden fear,
                its color palette shifting in response to emotional states—cool and soft when calm, vivid and erratic when agitated.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Beyond its ethereal form lies its defining ability: Cloud F.A.R.T can rearrange the atomic structures of surrounding materials,
                briefly altering their color or state, as if performing real-time alchemy.
                Each encounter with it produces a unique configuration—alive, unpredictable, and never repeating the same way twice.
