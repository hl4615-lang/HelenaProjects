    <h1>Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage — in Code</h1>
    <p>

      Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage refers to living traditions that are carried by people rather than preserved
      in objects: festivals, music, dance, storytelling, crafts, rituals, and everyday practices passed from one
      generation to the next. Unlike monuments or artifacts, these forms of heritage are fragile because they exist in
      performance, gesture, sound, and memory. They can fade quietly as lifestyles change, communities disperse, and
      fewer people continue the practices. Yet they also hold something essential: ways of celebrating, moving together,
      telling stories, and making meaning that cannot be fully captured by physical relics alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project treats the browser as a small “time capsule” for a few of these traditions. Instead of trying to
      archive everything, it focuses on a few symbolic fragments: a "dragon dance" reimagined as a segmented,
      breathing creature moving across a digital stage, and a **paper-cutting ritual** where the user “cuts” shapes out
      of virtual red paper. Each interactive sketch is built with p5.js and simple web technologies, translating
      movement, rhythm, and craft into code. Visitors are invited not just to look at screenshots of heritage, but to
      "participate" in it—by guiding the dragon with their mouse, triggering fireworks, or drawing their own cut-out
      shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is not to perfectly simulate reality, but to encode a feeling: the collective energy of 舞龙, the quiet
      concentration of 剪纸, the sense that these traditions are alive only when someone engages with them. By sending
      these interactive pieces “into the future” through the internet, the project asks a question to future
      viewers—human or otherwise: if the original practices have changed or disappeared by then, can these small, coded
      echoes still carry a trace of what it felt like to be here, now, inside this culture?
